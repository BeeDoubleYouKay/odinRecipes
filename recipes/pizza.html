    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <h3>For the dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g/7oz self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>large pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small garlic clove</li>
        <li>75g/2⅔oz passata</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>5 slices vegetarian salami, sliced</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz mozzarella, torn or sliced</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>fresh basil leaves, to garnish</li>
        <li>olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dough, mix the flour with the baking powder and salt. Pour the olive oil and 100ml/3½fl oz water into a jug. Gradually add the water and oil to the flour, stirring until you have a dough. Knead for 1 minute, until the dough is soft and pliable. Shape into a ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large frying pan until very hot and heat the grill to high.</li>
        <li>Grate the garlic into the passata and stir through the oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>On a well-floured surface, roll and stretch the dough into a large circle with thicker edges. Place in the hot frying pan. Cook until the base has begun to lightly brown and the dough is slightly dry on top.</li>
        <li>Top with the tomato sauce, salami and mozzarella. Transfer to the hot grill and cook until the cheese melts and the crust browns - watch carefully at this stage to ensure the crust doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving plate and garnish with basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
